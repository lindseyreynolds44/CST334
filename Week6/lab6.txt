Description: This file answers the questions from lab 6


Step 1: Explain what happens when you run the threadSync.c program? 
    When this program runs, it simply creates 10 threads, using a loop. 
    Each thread calls the go() function. In the go() function, a semaphore 
    called "mutex" is used as a lock, to make sure only one thread at a 
    time can execute the critical section of the program. The critical 
    section of code simply prints out which thread has the lock 
    and then returns after releasing it. 


Step 2: Done.
