Step 1: Explain what happens when you run the threadSync.c program? 
    When this program runs, it simply creates 10 threads, using a loop. 
    Each thread calls the go() function, which uses the semaphore, called
    mutex as a lock, in order to keep more than one thread at a time from
    executing the critical section within the go() function. The critical 
    section of code simply prints out which thread has the lock 
    and then returns after releasing it.
