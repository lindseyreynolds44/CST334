Lab 6

What it Does:
- This program demonstrates the utility of semaphores to create the
iconic producer and consumer threads. The producer thread adds each 
letter of the alphabet to a buffer and the consumer removes and reads
them from the buffer, whenever there are letters to read. 
- NOTE: This program is specifically written to run on a Mac.

How to Run:
- Type "make" into the terminal or command line
- Type "./producerConsumer" to run the program
